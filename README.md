## Wins and Improvements

GokuSpace was successful in creating an intuitive way for users to explore the application and network with their peers.
The project was also successful in creating a database schema to store the data about users and their network connections,
and creating the necessary API endpoints to provide the front-end with up-to-date and relevent information.

Some improvements that could be made to the project include refining the features of the application, 
such as allowing users to search for events by date, and view other users profiles.
